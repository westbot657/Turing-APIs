# Turing API

The API is a work in progress, and I will try to get as many languages to be supported as I can.  

Current language support status:

| Language       | State                           |
|----------------|---------------------------------|
| Rust           | Fully supported                 |
| Zig            | Supported                       |
| C/C++          | Supported                       |
| AssemblyScript | Supported                       |
| Lua (Pallene)  | Supportable with effort         |
| Python         | Supportable with effort         |
| Java/Kotlin    | Maybe supportable with effort   |
| C#             | Maybe supportable with effort   |
