# Turing API

The API is a work in progress, and I will try to get as many languages to be supported as I can.  

Current language support status:

| Language               | State                         |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Rust                   | Fully supported               |
| Zig                    | Fully Supported               |
| C/C++                  | Fully Supported               |
| TS/JS (AssemblyScript) | Fully Supported               |
| Lua (nelua)            | Fully Supported               |
| Python                 | Supportable with effort       |
| Java/Kotlin            | Maybe supportable with effort |
| C#                     | Maybe supportable with effort |
