# Turing API

The API is a work in progress, and I will try to get as many languages to be supported as I can.  

Current language support status:

| Language       | State                           |
|----------------|---------------------------------|
| Rust           | Fully supported                 |
| Zig            | Fully supported, Incomplete API |
| C/C++          | Supportable                     |
| Lua            | Supportable with effort         |
| Python         | Supportable with effort         |
| JS/TS          | Maybe supportable with effort   |
| Java/Kotlin    | Maybe supportable with effort   |
| C#             | Maybe supportable with effort   |
| AssemblyScript | Maybe supportable with effort   |
